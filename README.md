# Java Calculator

This is the first Java program that I applied everything I've learned so far, and it is a simple terminal calculator.

## Features
* Can handle multiple subsequent basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)<br><br>
* Has an option to reset variables and start over.

## How It Works
The program relies heavily on while loops to manage the different functionalities, since I'm still learning about classes and object-oriented programming stuff.

  obs. Because I had some issues with using Git along with my IDE, I've only displayed the src .java file on this repository.
